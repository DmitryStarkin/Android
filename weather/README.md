**Application to display the weather**

The app displays weather, obtained from the site http://openweathermap.org.

The list of cities is stored in a local database SQLite,
for asynchronous requests to the database using the native library.

To query the API used Retrofit 2.

For getting and caching of weather icons used Picasso.

To build the application used library Dugger 2.

The application has a Widget.

The app is in development.
Now there is refactoring in order that you could add the following functionality
1. Request the weather from different API
2. Request the weather by coordinates
3. Ability to add different widgets
